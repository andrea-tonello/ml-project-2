# Kernel Ridge Regression and Kernal PCA
The goal of this project is to show why it is better (or not) to use kernelised methods in two toy data sets, and find out which kernel is the most suitable for each.    
There are two main tasks:
1. Ridge Regression vs Kernel Ridge Regression
2. PCA vs Kernel PCA
